# forensicsdemo

This project was created for the Digital Forensics and File Recovery Workshop taught at BsidesPDX 2023.

Authors: Travis Noyes, Lance Miller, David Baker-Robinson

## Instructions

If you'd like to try some hands-on forensics yourself, review the slides, and complete the checklist (CTFChecklist.pdf). You'll need to get a physical copy of the flash drive from one of the workshop presenters. Unfortunately you won't be able to complete this without it.

That's it!
